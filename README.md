## Install and run

First, clone the code into a local repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/noahambard/cells_py.git
```

Then move into that repository:

```sh
cd cells_py
```

Install the dependencies into a virtual environment:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(You can exit the virtual environment with `deactivate`)

Finally, run the program from the root directory:

```sh
python src/cells.py
```
